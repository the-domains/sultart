            <title><![CDATA[Portraits: Beautiful Women]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Portraits: Beautiful Women</h1><p>Each abstract piece in this series is my interpretation of a woman that I know personally. This is how I see them - not just their physical appearance, but their hearts, minds, strength, and inner beauty as well. First, we have "Sharon". She is a beautiful, complex, loving, and amazing woman, strong and steadfast in her beliefs and principles. Next, we have "Sa'mya". She is exploding with energy, life, imagination, and curiosity. Then there's "Luna". She is calm, centered, at one with nature, and wise beyond her years. Finally, we have "Penny". She was my mother, Penny J. Sult, the most beautiful person I've ever known. She passed away in 2006, and is greatly missed because she impacted the lives of so many. This series began with her, and is dedicated to her memory. I hope you enjoy these pieces. Perhaps they will remind you of someone you know, or even a part of you.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9115ff31f687a852e354047ef3367b21c650af93.jpg"></article>]]></description>
