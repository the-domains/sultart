Life. Death. Rebirth... How can a piece of furniture be sold as "shabby chic" or "distressed", but be considered "junk" if it's in an alley? What do you see here? What could these things become? It's about how you see things, and what you do with them once you decide how to see them. Reduce, reuse, recycle, upcycle... These items had a previous "life" or use. Now move past these objects... Consider human life. How many people do we abandon every day without bothering to help them, or even look and see their potential? Do you WELCOME challenges, and others in need? Or does your expression, attitude, or speech say DO NOT DISTURB!!.....? Let's start changing faces.... For the better. Let's not ignore the faces around us that change because they need us. There are many reasons, but PTSD is especially important to me. BECOME A PART OF MY INSTALLATION... Sign the name of anyone you know, including yourself, who has been affected by PTSD!! Go to www.ptsd.va.gov to learn more about PTSD.
